            My mother is the one and only Mayma, wife of Fady. <br>

            Bonjour, I am Nabeel. <br>
            I am a student at UMD suffering whilst trying to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science. <br> 
            I am also suffering at the hands of Tokoebe the Trainer. <br>
            I like to think of myself as extremely intelligent, although that might not necessarily be true. <br>
            I see myself in 10 years pursuing a career as a Formula 1 driver. Although right now I am driving a Toyota Car, We'll see how that goes.<br> 
            My greatest nightmare is taking out trash and doing laundry, in other words I am lazyyy <br>
